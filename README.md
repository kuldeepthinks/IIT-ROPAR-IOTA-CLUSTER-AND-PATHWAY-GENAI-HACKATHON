# Breaking News Intelligence Chatbot
# IIT Ropar IOTA Cluster & Pathway GenAI Hackathon Project

## Project Overview
In today’s fast-moving world, news changes every second. Traditional chatbots rely on **static data** and cannot reflect live updates, making it hard for journalists, analysts, and the public to get **up-to-date verified information**.

The **Breaking News Intelligence Chatbot** uses **Pathway LiveAI™ + Dynamic RAG** to:  
- Continuously ingest live news from **APIs, RSS, and social media**.  
- Answer queries in **real time** with the most current context.  
- Provide **instant, contextual summaries** across multiple domains: tech, finance, sports, and politics.

## Features
- 🔄 **Live Data Ingestion** → NewsAPI, RSS feeds, Twitter/X.  
- ⚡ **Dynamic RAG** → Continuously indexed knowledge for LLMs.  
- 💬 **Smart Chatbot** → Contextual summaries & Q&A.  
- ⏱️ **Low Latency** → Millisecond-level responses.  
- 🌍 **Multi-domain Coverage** → Tech, Finance, Sports, Politics.

## Tech Stack
- **Pathway** → Live data ingestion + RAG pipelines.  
- **Pathway LLM Templates** → Pre-built chatbot templates.  
- **LLM** → OpenAI GPT / Gemini / Llama 3.  
- **Frontend** → Streamlit / React / Lovable UI.

## Architecture
```
Live News Sources (APIs / RSS / Twitter)
               │
       Pathway Ingestion Engine
               │
       Dynamic RAG Indexing
               │
          LLM Query Layer
               │
           Chatbot UI
```
**Flow:** New data → ingested by Pathway → indexed by Dynamic RAG → LLM answers → displayed in chatbot.

## Demo Instructions
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuldeepthinks/IIT-ROPAR-IOTA-CLUSTER-AND-PATHWAY-GENAI-HACKATHON.git
cd IIT-ROPAR-IOTA-CLUSTER-AND-PATHWAY-GENAI-HACKATHON
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the chatbot:
```bash
python src/main.py
# OR launch Lovable UI
```
4. Demo Flow:
   - Ask: *“What’s the latest in AI in India?”* → Bot responds with recent headlines.  
   - Add new feed (e.g., sports/finance).  
   - Ask: *“Latest sports news?”* → Bot reflects updated feed.

## GitHub Repos Used
- [Pathway](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway) → Core engine for live data ingestion & Dynamic RAG.  
- [Pathway LLM Templates](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app) → Pre-built LLM chatbot templates.

## Future Scope
- Multi-language support (Hindi, Spanish, etc.).  
- AI fact-checking module to reduce misinformation.  
- Voice-enabled news assistant.  
- Personalized news feeds per user.

## Why This Project Stands Out
- Everyone relates to **breaking news**.  
- Demo is **visual + instant** → judges see real-time updates live.  
- Highlights **Pathway’s LiveAI™ + Dynamic RAG strengths**.  
- Scalable for enterprise & media applications.
